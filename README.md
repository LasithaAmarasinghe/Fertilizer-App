# Fertilizer App: Potato Disease Identification 🌱🦠

The **Fertilizer App** is designed to help identify common potato leaf diseases using deep learning models. Currently, the model is trained to classify potato leaves into three categories:

- **Early Blight** 🌿
- **Late Blight** 🍂
- **Healthy** ✅

In the future, this app will be generalized to support more crop diseases and broader agricultural applications.

## Features 🎉

- **Disease Detection**: Uses a TensorFlow model to predict diseases in potato leaves from uploaded images.
- **Model Inference**: Upload an image of a potato leaf, and the model will predict if the leaf is healthy or affected by diseases like Early Blight or Late Blight.
- **Future Expansion**: The model is being generalized to support other crops and their respective diseases.
